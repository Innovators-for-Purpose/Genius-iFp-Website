            <h2 class="title">About Dr. E. Ronald McNair</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="text">
                In 1959, Ronald McNair, a 9-year-old Black boy in Lake City, South Carolina, walked into a segregated library determined to borrow books. Despite being told the library was not for Black people, he refused to leave. The librarian called the police, and his mother was summoned. Ultimately, the police instructed the librarian to let him borrow the books. This act of quiet defiance highlighted McNair's determination to pursue knowledge. The library that once denied him access is now named the Ronald McNair Life History Center, a testament to his legacy.

            <p class="text">
                McNair's passion for learning and science propelled him to extraordinary heights. He earned a BS degree in Physics from NC A&T STATE UNIVERSITY in 1971 and a PhD in Physics from the MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT) in 1976, specializing in laser physics, and became a NASA astronaut in 1978. In 1984, he flew aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger, becoming the second Black American in space. Tragically, he lost his life on January 28, 1986 on his second mission into space aboard Space Shuttle Challenger.

            <p class="text">
                McNair's story is one of resilience and achievement, inspiring generations to overcome adversity and reach for the stars.
